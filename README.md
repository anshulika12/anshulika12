4. 💳 Online Payment Fraud Exploratory Data Analysis

🗓️ Jun 2023

🕵️‍♀️ Conducted an exhaustive analysis of an online payment transaction dataset with Python, finding fraud predominantly occurred in 'cashout' and 'transfer' modes and within certain transaction amount ranges (1.3-3.6 lakh). Noted significant shortcomings in the current fraud detection system, with 99.805% of fraud transactions incorrectly flagged.

🚨 The project underscored the urgent necessity to enhance fraud detection techniques due to the growing dependence on online payments and to concentrate on high-risk transaction categories for improved preventive measures.
