My Projects:

1. Netflix Movies and TV Shows Exploratory Data Analysis
April 2023 - May 2023
‚Ä¢ Utilized Python for data analysis on an 8,807-title Netflix dataset, identifying that 69.6% were movies and highlighting the United States as the leading content contributor.
‚Ä¢ Leveraged NLTK in Python to perform sentiment analysis, revealing 46.78% positive and 43.61% negative title reception, with a trend toward mature content and top five genres making up over 50% of content.

2. Customer Service Request Analysis
May 2023 -June 2023
‚Ä¢ Utilized Python for processing and analyzing a comprehensive NYC 311 service request dataset, refining skills in data cleaning, datetime manipulation, and creating new derived metrics
‚Ä¢ Developed proficiency in data visualization and mining techniques, drawing four significant patterns related to service request frequency, response time, and trends grouped by location, thus improving abilities in pattern recognition and insightful analysis.

3. Amazon Sales Exploratory Data Analysis
Mar 2023 - Apr 2023
‚Ä¢ Utilized Python to clean and preprocess an expansive dataset comprising more than 1000 real products listed in the Amazon marketplace specifically from India. This project allowed me to handle real-world data in its raw, unorganized form and refine my skills in data cleaning.
‚Ä¢ Leveraged Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for creating compelling visualizations that effectively communicated my findings. The visualizations encompassed a wide range of aspects, including sales distribution, category-wise product count, and price trends.
‚Ä¢ Through this analysis, I gained insights into the Amazon India marketplace and its customer purchasing behaviors, which can be utilized for targeted marketing and sales optimization strategies.

4. Online Payment Fraud Exploratory Data Analysis
Jun 2023
‚Ä¢ Applied Python to conduct an extensive analysis of an online payment transaction dataset, finding that fraud largely occurred in 'cashout' and 'transfer' modes and within certain transaction amount ranges (1.3-3.6 lakh). Also noted significant issues with the current fraud detection system, as 99.805% of fraud transactions were not correctly flagged.
‚Ä¢ The project highlighted the imminent need to improve fraud detection techniques, given the rising reliance on online payments, and to focus on high-risk transaction categories for better preventive measures.
